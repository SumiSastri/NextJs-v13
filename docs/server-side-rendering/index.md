# What is server-side-rendering

Client-side-rendering all code is rendered in the browser on the client-side. 

With server-side-rendering, a smaller set of bundled JavaScript files hydrate the HTML root file and the CSS is written in JavaScript -  all of this happens server-side. The load on browser JavaScript engines is lower and page rendering is speeded up.

The page is compiled and rendered in compile-time not in run-time as with client-side rendering.

Client-side-rendering all code is written and rendered in the browser on the client-side. This results in slower rendering as the browsers' JavaScript engine is parsing a lot of bundled JavaScript, hyper-text-markup-language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS) files on the fly.
