# What is a static-site generator

Static websites are those that use hyper-text-markup-language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS) only. They may have some JavaScript.

A static site generator(SSG) is a package that then renders these pages on the browser.

SSGs generates static HTML pages using a combination of pre-built templates, components and data.

Also see server-side-rendering and server-components sections.
