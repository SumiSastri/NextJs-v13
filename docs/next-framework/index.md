# NextJS as a framework

NextJS is an opinionated framework and not a library.

Under the hood it uses the React Component library, compiles with SWC, webpack, babel and has its own opinions on routing, static rendering, server-side-rendering and in with Next 13 offers server and client components.

Using NextJS comes with trade offs and there are other options to consider if the solutions offered by NextJS do not work for your use case.
