What are server components?

Server components are available by default. They do not need to be hydrated in the browser. Less JavaScript bundled files are sent to the browser so the code efficiency is better.

Server components are good for API-keys, access tokens and large datasets that can be handled on the backend of the application rather than the front end.

When to use server components vs client components?
