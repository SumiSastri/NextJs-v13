# Tutorials

A really good crash course to get you started - but not great for CRUD/ auth and routing

Some standout tutorials in the series

- [Tutorial 4: Layouts and Links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwg4Wrk-kWE)

- [Tutorial 6: Data-fetching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAXWRgEo7Ns)

- [Tutorial 8: Static page rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihmyC4Ei2zY&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jZIVqmy_QhfQdi6mzQvJnT&index=8&t=129s)

I found this course boring and because you have to download files, you do not know how to build a package up from scratch, which I don't think is particularly useful.
