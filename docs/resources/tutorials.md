# Tutorials

- [PluralSight NextJS the big Picture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/nextjs-12-big-picture/table-of-contents)

Although about Next12, Cory House's basic overview of how NextJS works as a framework is well worth reviewing. While it has no code or projects to follow, the theoretical principles of NextJS as a framework are well explained. NextJS 13 and NextJS 14 are merely package variations and updates to the basic principles outlined in this tutorial.

- [NetNinja Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJQbDPGzm0Y&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jZIVqmy_QhfQdi6mzQvJnT)

A really good crash course to get you started - but not great for CRUD/ auth and routing. Some standout tutorials in the series.

- [Tutorial 4: Layouts and Links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwg4Wrk-kWE)

- [Tutorial 6: Data-fetching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAXWRgEo7Ns)

- [Tutorial 8: Static page rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihmyC4Ei2zY&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jZIVqmy_QhfQdi6mzQvJnT&index=8&t=129s)


- [PluralSight NextJS 13 Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/nextjs-13-fundamentals/table-of-contents) 

I found this course boring and because you have to download files, you do not know how to build a package up from scratch, which I don't think is particularly useful.
